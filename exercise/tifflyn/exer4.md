Here’s a more professional version with icons. Markdown supports limited icons, but here I’ve used Markdown emoji syntax where possible to give a polished look. For a more comprehensive style, you might use specialized Markdown tools or HTML/CSS in conjunction with Markdown for full control over styling.
